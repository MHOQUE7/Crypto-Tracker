How It Works

First you will see a main menu
When you run the program, you’ll see the following options:

1. View top cryptocurrencies

2. Search for a cryptocurrency

3. Save data to CSV

4. Visualize data

5. Exit

Visualizations

You can generate:

Bar Chart: Displays prices of the top cryptocurrencies.

Pie Chart: Shows market cap distribution.

Line Chart: Tracks 24-hour percentage price changes.

Core Functions and Purpose
Core Functions
The Crypto Tracker project provides a comprehensive tool for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, analysts, and learners:

Fetch Real-Time Data:
Utilizes the CoinGecko API to gather up-to-date cryptocurrency prices, market caps, and 24-hour percentage changes.
Search Specific Cryptocurrencies:
Enables users to find detailed information about any cryptocurrency by its name or symbol.
Save Data Locally:
Exports cryptocurrency data to CSV format for offline analysis or record-keeping.
Visualize Data:
Generates bar, pie, and line charts to present data visually, making it easier to spot trends and insights.
Skills and Technologies Demonstrated
This project showcases the following programming and technical skills:

Python Programming:
Developed a modular and structured codebase with reusable functions.
API Integration:
Learned how to interact with a public API (CoinGecko) to fetch and handle JSON data.
Data Visualization:
Used Matplotlib to create meaningful visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and line charts.
File Handling:
Exported data to CSV files using Python’s built-in csv library for persistent storage.
Error Handling:
Incorporated robust error handling for API requests and user input validation.
Command-Line Interface (CLI):
Built an intuitive and user-friendly CLI for seamless interaction with the program.
Git and GitHub:
Practiced version control by managing and publishing the project to a GitHub repository.
What I Learned
API Integration:
Gained experience with making HTTP requests, understanding endpoints, and handling JSON data structures.
Data Processing:
Learned how to extract, transform, and represent data in a way that makes sense to users.
Visualization:
Improved my ability to translate raw data into visual formats that highlight patterns and trends.
Error Handling and Debugging:
Enhanced my ability to identify, debug, and resolve issues in real-time.
Modular Programming:
Understood the importance of organizing code into separate, reusable modules for clarity and maintenance.
Purpose of the Project
This project solves real-world problems and serves multiple purposes:

Simplifies Data Analysis:
Converts raw cryptocurrency data into actionable insights through visualizations and easy-to-read formats.
Serves Beginners and Experts:
Provides an intuitive tool for beginners to learn about cryptocurrencies and for analysts to quickly access relevant data.
Practical Application:
Encourages learning by building something useful, helping users understand cryptocurrencies better while enhancing technical skills.
Portfolio Enhancement:
Acts as a showcase of programming abilities, problem-solving approach, and understanding of data-centric applications.
