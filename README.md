How It Works

First you will see a main menu
When you run the program, youâ€™ll see the following options:

1. View top cryptocurrencies

2. Search for a cryptocurrency

3. Save data to CSV

4. Visualize data

5. Exit

Visualizations

You can generate:

Bar Chart: Displays prices of the top cryptocurrencies.

Pie Chart: Shows market cap distribution.

Line Chart: Tracks 24-hour percentage price changes.

Core Functions and Purpose

Core Functions

The Crypto Tracker project offers essential functionalities for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and analysts. It fetches real-time data using the CoinGecko API, enabling users to view top cryptocurrencies by market cap, search for specific coins, and save data to CSV files for offline use. Additionally, it visualizes cryptocurrency data through bar, pie, and line charts, providing clear insights into market trends.

Skills and Technologies Demonstrated

This project highlights a variety of technical and programming skills. It demonstrates Python proficiency through a modular and reusable codebase. Integration with the CoinGecko API showcases the ability to handle HTTP requests and JSON data. The use of Matplotlib for data visualization emphasizes analytical skills, while file handling with the CSV module adds a practical storage component. Additionally, error handling and user-friendly CLI design enhance usability. Version control with Git and GitHub ensures proper project management and collaboration readiness.

What I Learned

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in API integration, understanding how to make HTTP requests and work with data endpoints. I improved my data processing skills by extracting, transforming, and displaying information effectively. Visualization using Matplotlib helped me present complex data trends in a digestible format. I also honed my debugging and error-handling abilities while learning the importance of modular programming for better code organization and maintainability.

Purpose of the Project

The Crypto Tracker serves as a practical tool that simplifies cryptocurrency analysis for both beginners and experts. It transforms raw data into actionable insights with its visualizations and CSV exports, making it easier to understand market trends. The project also provided a hands-on learning experience, enhancing my technical skills and preparing me for future data-centric projects. Lastly, it serves as a portfolio piece that showcases my ability to create meaningful, real-world applications.
